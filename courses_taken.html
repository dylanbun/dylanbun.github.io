      <div id="project-details">
        <div class="subheader-text">CSEM 544: Database Internals, Sp23</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">Learned about the functionality of DBMS internals and design considerations. The entire quarter is spent building SimpleDB, a simple DBMS that uses bare minimum policies such as NO-FORCE/STEAL and page-locking granularity. Implemented a buffer pool, lock manager, log manager, query parser, and operators for queries. 544 is the master's version of 444 but is co-jointly offered. The master's version has students read five important database papers throughout the quarter and write a one to two page paper responding to questions regarding the research papers read. These papers ranged from the various data model proposals, DBMS architecture, query optimization, and parallel DBMSs vs MapReduce. </div>
          <div class="body-text">Coursework was alternating between a worksheet or lab every week. The labs were done in partners so this made the course possible to balance with other difficult courses. Weekly time commitment was between 3 to 8 hours.</div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="project-details">
        <div class="subheader-text">CSE 446: Machine Learning, Sp23</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">Learned about various methods to design models that learn from data and improve as they continue to see more data. Course covered a wide variety of topics but here is a list of some: norms, least squares, ridge regression, Lasso, gradient descent (and stochastic gradient descent), SVMs, kernels, neural networks, nearest neighbors, trees, CIFAR-10 and MNIST using CNNs, random forests, k-means, PCA, bootstrapping, and CNNs. This course was very theory driven, and thus math heavy. Requires lots of linear algebra review to help keep up with the content.</div>
          <div class="body-text">The coursework was five total psets but each one would take between twenty-five to thirty hours to complete. Be prepared to devote lots of time towards this course! Weekly time commitment was between 10 to 15 hours.</div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="project-details">
        <div class="subheader-text">CSE 421: Introduction to Algorithms, Wi23</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">A proof-heavy course that focused on types of problems and techniques for how to design efficient algorithms to solve these problems. Problem types ranged from stable matching, greedy, minimum spanning trees, dynamic programming (1D and 2D), flow, reductions, and linear programs. </div>
          <div class="body-text">The coursework consisted of a weekly pset that would have between four to six problems. Time commitment was between 15 to 25 hours depending on the difficulty and time spent writing the proofs.</div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="project-details">
        <div class="subheader-text">CSE 442: Data Visualization, Wi23</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">Introduced theory and techniques for how to design effective visualizations of data based on principles of graphic designed. Used various software such as D3.js, Vega-Lite, Observable notebooks, and Tableau. Learned about deceptive and interactive visualization. As the final project, you get to work in a group to create an interactive visualization that teaches about a concept using concepts such as storytelling, color, animation, narratives, networks, and maps.</div>
          <div class="body-text">The coursework in the first half was individual assignments but would be quick so about 3 to 5 hours each week (including the required lecture participation). The second half of the quarter you would work in groups to work on interactive visualization and a final project that teaches something using interactive visualization which was a time commitment between 10 to 15 hours per week.</div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="project-details">
        <div class="subheader-text">CSE 344: Introduction to Data Management, Au22</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">Introduced database management systems and how to write applications that used these database systems. Primary focus was how to write queries and how to query effectively and correctly. The second half of the quarter was spent working on the Flights booking application which used Java and Azure as a DBMS. Other topics included relational algebra, indexes, various data models (relation, semi-structured, key-value), and BCNF.</div>
          <div class="body-text">The coursework in the first half were weekly gradescope assignments where you would write queries and report the output. The second half was ER-diagrams and working on Flights. Weekly time commitment was between 3 to 8 hours since I already had DBMS experience from my summer internship.</div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="project-details">
        <div class="subheader-text">CSE 331: Software Design and Implementation, Au22</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">Learned concepts and techniques for how to design, test, and construct reliable and maintainable software in Java. Learned about forward and backwards reasoning given code snippets to practice code correctness and loop invariants. Quarter was devoted to building campus maps, a webapp that used React, Spark, and Java to help find the shortest location between two buildings at UW campus.</div>
          <div class="body-text">The coursework consisted of weekly worksheets and/or coding assignments. Weekly time commitment varied but already having experience was 3 to 8 hours. If I did not have prior experience with React it would be 10 to 15 hours as an estimate.</div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="project-details">
        <div class="subheader-text">CSE 440: Introduction to HCI, Sp22</div>

Also covered HCI theory and techniques such as Fitts' law, Sapir-Whorf, affordances, metaphors, and history of design.</div>
          <div class="body-text">The coursework consisted of biweekly checkpoints/indicators of progress that were to be completed as a group. Typically having one person be the "PM"/leader would make this easier to allocate the workload and keep track of progress. Since I took on this role, the weekly time commitment for me was 3 to 5 hours.</div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="project-details">

Weekly time commitment ranged from 10 to 15 hours where majority of the hours came from the later psets.</div>
        </div>
